Regular expression

Regular expression are special characters which help search data, matching complex patterns.


1. GREP (Global Regular Expression print)

The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern.

grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]


grep serchableword /filepath

grep -i wordtosearch /path	(-i flag ignore case sensitiveness)

grep -c wordtosearch /path	(-c count no of lines)

grep -ic wordtosearch /path	(both ignore case sensitive and count)

grep -in  word /path 	(-n number where word is matched)

grep word /path /path /path	(search in which file pattern match)

grep -v word /path 	(-v where pattern matches and print lines where pattern does not)

grep word$ /path	( print lines which ends with given word)

grep ^word /path	(print lines which start with given keyword)



if you forget file name then you can search within directory with "grep -r"

grep -r pattern /path

redirecting grep results inside a file:

grep pattern /path > newfile.txt

grep pattern /path >> newfile.txt	( >> append)

Find command:

sudo find / -name "mk.*"
(search in / name mk keep in double quote)

find /pathWhereToSearch -name "filename.extention"



Find while file belongs to user:

sudo find / -user username	(search while files and directories belongs to user)


find files permission with respect group:

sudo find / -group groupname



find files/directory as per permission:

find / -perm 4755	

(4- u+s  special permission, 7- rwx for owner, 5- rx for grp, 5-rx for others)


find files as per disc size:

find / -size +10M	(search files size more than 10 MB, crosscheck result- du -sh /path)



find / -size +60M -size -100M	(file side in between 60 to 100MB)






Find all files and dir created by ubuntu user and copy those resources into backup directory:

find /home/ubuntu/ -user ubuntu -exec cp -rvf {} /backup/ \;

(here, -exec execute, {} all, /backup/ path, \; this command run in loop so it will stop loop)





remove all the files created by ubuntu user:(it also deletes hme directory of ubuntu)

find /home/ubuntu -user ubuntu -exec rm -rvf {} \;



find files created by ubuntu and change all files owner to user mk:

find /home/ubuntu/ -user ubuntu -exec chown mk:mk {} \;		(  {}  means all reasults)


=========================================================================================================

head /filepath	: display top 10 lines of the path file

head -n 5 /path	:top 5 lines

tail /path	: no -n flag so it shows last 10 lines

tail -n 8 /etc/passwd	: go inside passwd file, display last 8 lines

wc /path	: 4 20 220 /display path.  here 4 - no of lines, 20 no of words, 220 no of characters(calculates empty spaces), wc - word count

wc -l /path	: no of lines
wc -w /path 	: no of words
wc -c /path	: no of char
