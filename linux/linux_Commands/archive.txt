how to archive?

mkdir /imp

tar -cvzf /home/mk/imp/backup.gz /usr/sbin

	(c: create, v- verbos, z: zip, f: force fully, /imp/backup.gz  create backup.gz file ,  /usr/sbin : from here we shall archive files, go inside sbin copy files and archive to backup.gz )


check disk space :

du -sh /home/mk/imp	(du- disk usage, -sh show)



tar -cvjf /home/mk/imp/backup.tar.gz2 /usr/sbin	    (j: for bz2 algorithm/technology , compress more than gz )


tar -cvJf /home/mk/imp/backup.tar.xz /usr/sbin	    (capital J: for xz algorithm/technology , xz : exgible, compress more then gz2 and gz )



tar -tvf filename		(show file permissions, -t : test)




How to extract?

tar -xvf /home/mk/imp/backup.gz		(x- extract, here we are extracting in same directory)


tar -xvzf  /pathwithfilename -C /NewDirectoryPathToExtact	(Extracting indifferent directory)

tar -xvjf  /pathwithfilename -C /NewDirectoryPathToExtact

tar -xvJf  /pathwithfilename -C /NewDirectoryPathToExtact
